Next Up On GeeCON
=================
Is a (more or less) simple **pure JavaScript** app that'll be used to display data about upcomming sessions during breaks during **GeeCON 2011** in Cracow.
The app will be displayed on big cinema screens... :-)

Used tech
---------
The app relies on the following frameworks to get things done:

* **Backbone.js** - a very awesome JavaScript MVC framework which made the development of this app a pure joy for the senses ;-)
* **underscore.js** - a simple 'functional' library for JavaScript, it's used internally by backbone and by me for some \_.filter, \_.map(), \_.fold() fun :-)
* **jQuery** - a quite big yet powerful lib everybody knows I guess. It's used here primarily to bind the app into the DOM and modify it. Oh, and it's also used here for AJAX stuff.
* **@anywhere** - I thought I'd use it (it's the new twitter API) but it turned out that it isn't supporting Status.search... (Though it's in it's documentation heh) so we're using plain old search.twitter.com here, and it runns really well ;-)
